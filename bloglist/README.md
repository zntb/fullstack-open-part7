## 7.9: Automatic Code Formatting

In the previous parts, we used ESLint to ensure that the code follows the
defined conventions. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is yet another approach
for the same. According to the documentation, Prettier is an _opinionated code
formatter_, that is, Prettier not only controls the code style but also formats
the code according to the definition.

is automatically formatted.
